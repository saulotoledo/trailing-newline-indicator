* Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a **new branch** for your feature or fix:
    #+begin_src sh
    git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
    #+end_src
4. Write your Emacs Lisp code, ensuring it passes [[https://melpa.org/#/flycheck][flycheck]] and [[https://github.com/purcell/package-lint][package-lint]].
5. Follow the commit message guidelines below.
6. Push your branch and open a **Pull Request (PR)** against the `main` branch
   of the original repository.

* Commit Message Guidelines

We enforce the use of **Conventional Commits** for all contributions. This helps
automate changelog generation and semantic versioning.

Your commit message must start with a **type** and a brief **scope** (optional,
in parentheses), followed by a colon and the subject. The commit description
should start with a lowercase letter to maintain consistency with the other
repository commit messages.

#+begin_example
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
#+end_example

| Type | Description | Effect (Semantic Versioning) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **feat** | A new feature or enhancement. | Minor release (vX.Y.0) |
| **fix** | A bug fix (e.g., solving the focus error). | Patch release (vX.Y.Z) |
| **docs** | Changes to documentation only. | No version bump |
| **style** | Formatting changes (white-space, semi-colons, etc.). | No version bump |
| **refactor** | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature. | No version bump |
| **perf** | A code change that improves performance. | Patch or Minor |
| **test** | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests. | No version bump |
| **build** | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies. | No version bump |

*Example Commit:*
#+begin_example
fix(focus): remove invalid focus-in/out hook associations
#+end_example

To introduce a **BREAKING CHANGE**, you must include the text *BREAKING CHANGE:*
in the body or footer of the commit, which triggers a Major version bump.

For more information about conventional commits, please refer to [[https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/][this page]].

* Semantic Versioning Policy

This project adheres to **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** using the format *MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH*.

- **MAJOR (X.y.z):** Incremented when there are incompatibility changes.
  Requires a `BREAKING CHANGE` commit.
- **MINOR (x.Y.z):** Incremented when new features are added in a
  backwards-compatible manner. Triggered by a `feat` commit.
- **PATCH (x.y.Z):** Incremented when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made.
  Triggered by a `fix` commit.

The maintainer will handle the version bumping and tagging based on your commit
history.

* Licensing

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the
package's existing license.
